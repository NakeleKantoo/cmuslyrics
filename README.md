## How to install?
#### Dependencies:
- cmus
- clyrics
- viu
- python3
- tput
#### Installing:
You can just clone the repo and make the main.py an executable:
```
git clone https://github.com/nakelekantoo/cmuslyrics.git
chmod +x ./main.py
```
After that if you want to put it in your bin folder and change the name to cmuslyrics, it's really simple:
```
sudo mv ./main.py /usr/bin/cmuslyrics
```
(Maybe someday I'll make a proper install script, but for now this'll do)
